# Writing Samples Guide

This folder contains your technical and scientific writing samples. The ability to communicate complex spatial analysis clearly and professionally is a critical skill in GIS careers.

## What to Include

**Include writing that:**
- Demonstrates your ability to explain technical concepts clearly
- Shows scientific writing skills (proper citations, methodology, results)
- Relates to GIS, remote sensing, or spatial analysis
- You're proud of and represents your best work
- Is professionally written and proofread

**You don't need to include:**
- Every lab report you've ever written
- Writing assignments you struggled with or didn't enjoy
- Work with poor grades or feedback
- Papers on topics unrelated to your career interests

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. 2-3 strong writing samples are better than 10 mediocre ones.

## Types of Writing to Consider

### Research Papers
Long-form scientific papers (8-10 pages) that demonstrate:
- Literature review and research skills
- Hypothesis development and testing
- Methodology documentation
- Results interpretation and discussion
- Proper citations and academic writing

### Lab Reports
Technical reports documenting GIS analysis or remote sensing work:
- Clear problem statements
- Well-documented methods
- Integration of maps/figures with text
- Professional conclusions and recommendations

### Technical Memos
Brief (2-4 page) professional communications:
- Concise problem description
- Key findings
- Recommendations based on analysis
- Professional formatting and tone

### Case Studies
In-depth analysis of real-world spatial problems:
- Problem context and stakeholders
- Data sources and methods
- Multiple analysis approaches
- Practical applications and outcomes

### Research Proposals
Documents proposing future research or projects:
- Research questions and significance
- Methodology and timeline
- Resource requirements
- Expected outcomes

## What Makes Strong Technical Writing?

### Clear Structure
- **Introduction**: What's the problem or question?
- **Methods**: How did you approach it?
- **Results**: What did you find?
- **Discussion/Conclusion**: What does it mean?

### Integration of Visual Elements
- Maps and figures should support the text
- Each figure should be referenced in text
- Captions should be descriptive
- Visual quality should be professional

### Professional Tone
- Use appropriate technical terminology
- Avoid overly casual language
- Write in third person for formal papers
- Proofread thoroughly

### Documentation
- Cite data sources properly
- Reference methods and prior work
- Include methodology details that allow replication
- Acknowledge limitations

## File Formats

**Upload PDFs directly to this `writing/` folder:**
- PDFs preserve formatting across devices
- Easier to share and download
- Professional appearance
- Original Word/LaTeX files can stay on your local machine

**File naming:**
- Use descriptive names: `watershed-analysis-report.pdf`
- Avoid spaces: use hyphens or underscores
- Include year if helpful: `urban-heat-island-study-2024.pdf`

## Creating Your Landing Page

Use `writing-samples.md` as your landing page that:
- Lists all writing samples
- Provides brief context for each (course, date, topic)
- Links to the PDF files
- Highlights key skills demonstrated

## Tips for Success

### Before Uploading
- **Get permission**: If it was collaborative work, ensure you can share it
- **Remove sensitive info**: Redact any confidential data or proprietary information
- **Proofread again**: Even if it was graded, check for errors
- **Update formatting**: Ensure consistent headers, page numbers, professional appearance

### Presenting Writing Samples
- **Context matters**: Explain what course or project it was for
- **Highlight relevance**: Note which skills it demonstrates
- **Be selective**: Only include your best work
- **Update regularly**: Replace weaker samples as you produce stronger work

### During Interviews
- Be prepared to discuss your writing
- Know your methods and findings
- Be honest about collaborative vs. individual work
- Have specific examples ready of challenges you overcame

## How Much Writing to Include?

**Minimum**: 1-2 samples showing you can write professionally about GIS/remote sensing work

**Recommended**: 2-4 samples showing range:
- One longer research paper or case study
- One technical report or lab report  
- One brief technical memo (optional)

**Maximum**: 5-6 samples (more than this becomes overwhelming)

## Examples

### Strong Writing Sample Description

**Title**: Urban Heat Island Analysis Using Landsat Thermal Imagery  
**Course**: GIS 3012 - Advanced Remote Sensing  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Topics**: Remote sensing, thermal analysis, urban climatology, Python programming

This 10-page research paper examines the relationship between land cover types and surface temperatures in metropolitan Denver. Methods include atmospheric correction of Landsat 8 thermal bands, land surface temperature calculation, supervised classification of land cover, and statistical analysis of temperature variations across cover types. The study demonstrates technical writing skills, proper scientific methodology, and integration of remote sensing analysis with written communication.

### What to Avoid

**Weak description:**
"A paper I wrote for remote sensing class."

**Why it's weak**: No context, no indication of topic or methods, doesn't help reader understand what skills are demonstrated.
