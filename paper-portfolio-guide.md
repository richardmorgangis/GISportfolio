# Paper Portfolio Guide

## First Steps (When You're Ready to Interview)

Your goal: Create a professional print portfolio to bring to interviews.

1. **Build your online portfolio first** - Your paper portfolio draws from your online work
2. **Select 5-8 best projects** - Choose projects that show range and relevance to the job
3. **Choose 2-3 writing samples** - Include technical reports or papers that demonstrate communication skills
4. **Export to PDF** - Convert your best project pages and writing to high-quality PDFs
5. **Print professionally** - Use a quality printer or print shop (color, high resolution)
6. **Assemble in folder or binder** - Organize with cover page, resume, projects, writing samples
7. **Practice discussing your work** - Be ready to walk through each project confidently

**Timeline**: Start preparing your paper portfolio 2-3 weeks before your first interview.

## Next Steps (Maintaining Your Paper Portfolio)

- **Update before each interview** - Refresh with recent projects and tailor to the position
- **Print multiple copies** - Bring 2-3 copies for panel interviews
- **Keep it current** - Replace weaker projects as you produce stronger work
- **Archive versions** - Save PDFs of each version for future reference
- **Sync with online** - Your paper portfolio should complement, not duplicate, your online presence

## Why Bring a Paper Portfolio?

While your online portfolio is essential for job applications and professional networking, a physical portfolio serves a different purpose during in-person interviews:

**Provides a focal point** - Gives you and the interviewer something tangible to discuss and reference during the conversation

**Shows preparation** - Demonstrates professionalism and serious interest in the position

**Controls the narrative** - You decide what to highlight and in what order

**Works without technology** - No worries about internet connections, screen sharing issues, or device compatibility

**Leaves a lasting impression** - Interviewers can review it after you leave and share it with colleagues

**Accommodates different interview styles** - Some interviewers prefer physical materials they can annotate or pass around

## Selecting Content

### Quality Over Quantity
Your paper portfolio should be **selective**, not comprehensive. Aim for 5-8 strong projects that demonstrate:
- Range of technical skills
- Problem-solving abilities
- Professional-quality work
- Relevance to the position

### What to Include

**Project Pages** (1-2 pages per project)
- Project title and context
- Your role and objectives
- Methods and tools used
- Key findings or outputs
- High-quality map or visualization

**Writing Samples** (select 2-3)
- Technical reports or lab reports
- Research proposals
- Technical memos
- Case studies
- Grant proposals (if applicable)

**Resume/CV**
- Include an updated copy at the front

**Cover/Introduction Page**
- Your name and contact information
- Brief professional statement
- Table of contents

### What NOT to Include
- Every project you've ever done
- Low-quality or outdated work
- Unfinished projects
- Assignments you're not proud of
- Excessive personal information

## Including Writing Samples

Technical writing skills are highly valued in GIS careers. Your portfolio should demonstrate your ability to communicate complex spatial analysis clearly and professionally.

### Types of Writing to Include

**Lab Reports and Technical Reports**
- Show your ability to document methods and results
- Demonstrate scientific writing skills
- Include figures and maps integrated with text

**Research Proposals**

- Clear recommendations based on analysis

**Case Studies**
- In-depth analysis of a real-world problem
- Integration of multiple data sources and methods
- Professional presentation of complex information

### How to Present Writing Samples

**Full Document vs. Excerpts**
- Include full short documents (1-4 pages)
- For longer reports, include the executive summary plus 2-3 key pages
- Always include title page and any relevant figures/maps

**Formatting Considerations**
- Ensure text is readable when printed (12pt font minimum)
- Include page numbers
- Add a header with document title
- Highlight sections that demonstrate key skills

**Integration with Projects**
- Writing samples can complement project pages
- Example: project page shows the map, writing sample shows the full analysis and interpretation

**What to Highlight**
- Clear problem statements
- Well-documented methods
- Data source citations
- Integration of maps/figures with text
- Professional conclusions and recommendations

## Formatting for Print

### Converting Web Content to Print

**From Markdown/HTML**
1. Export project pages to PDF
2. Ensure proper page breaks
3. Verify images print at high quality
4. Check that links are represented (if relevant, include URLs as footnotes)

**Image Quality**
- Export maps and figures at 300 dpi minimum
- Use PNG or PDF format for graphics
- Ensure text on maps is readable when printed
- Test print one page before printing the entire portfolio

**Page Layout**
- Use consistent margins (1" on all sides is standard)
- Include headers or footers with your name and page numbers
- Ensure adequate white space
- Use a professional, readable font (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)

**Color Considerations**
- Ensure maps and graphics are legible in color
- Consider if black-and-white printing is sufficient
- Test print in both color and grayscale

### Organizing Your PDF

Create a master PDF document with:
1. Cover page with your name and contact info
2. Table of contents
3. Updated resume/CV
4. Project pages (1-2 pages each)
5. Writing samples (clearly labeled)
6. Optional: reference list or appendix

3. Export and format selected projects as PDFs
4. Assemble paper portfolio
5. After landing a job, archive that version and refresh for next opportunity

### Version Control
- Date your paper portfolio (e.g., "Portfolio - Fall 2024")
- Keep digital PDFs organized by date
- Update both portfolios at the end of each semester
- Retire weaker projects as you produce stronger work

Remember: Your paper portfolio is a conversation starter and professional tool. It should showcase your best work, demonstrate your range of skills (both technical and communication), and give interviewers concrete examples of what you can do. Keep it polished, selective, and ready to use at a moment's notice.
