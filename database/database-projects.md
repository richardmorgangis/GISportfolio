# Database Design & Data Modeling

Database design and spatial data management projects demonstrating my ability to design efficient, normalized database schemas and geodatabase structures for GIS applications.

---

## [Project Title - e.g., "Parks & Recreation Asset Management Database"]

**Course/Context:** [Course name or project context]  
**Date:** [Month Year]  
**Database Platform:** [PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite/SpatiaLite, ArcGIS Geodatabase, etc.]

### Overview
[2-3 sentence description of the database purpose, what data it manages, and who would use it]

### Database Design
[Brief description of your design approach and key decisions]

**Key Features:**
- [Feature 1 - e.g., Normalized to 3NF]
- [Feature 2 - e.g., Spatial indexing for performance]
- [Feature 3 - e.g., Relationship classes for data integrity]
- [Feature 4 - e.g., Domains and subtypes for data validation]

### Entity-Relationship Diagram
![ERD Diagram](../images/database-erd.png)

### Schema Components

**Tables/Feature Classes:**
- Table 1 - [Brief description and key fields]
- Table 2 - [Brief description and key fields]
- Table 3 - [Brief description and key fields]

**Relationships:**
- [Description of key relationships and cardinality]

**Constraints & Validation:**
- [Primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints, domains]

### Skills Demonstrated
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- ERD creation and data modeling
- Spatial database design
- [Geodatabase design / PostGIS implementation / etc.]
- Data integrity and validation
- [SQL / Python for database management]
- Performance optimization (indexing, spatial indexing)

### Technical Implementation
[Optional: Brief description of how the database was implemented, any challenges, or optimization strategies]
