# Web Applications Guide

This folder contains documentation and links to your web-based GIS applications. Web mapping and application development skills are increasingly important in the GIS industry, and your ArcGIS Online work demonstrates these capabilities.

## What to Include

**Include applications that:**
- Demonstrate web mapping and app development skills
- Solve real problems or tell compelling stories
- Show thoughtful design and user experience considerations
- You're proud of and can discuss confidently
- Are functional and publicly accessible

**You don't need to include:**
- Every class exercise or tutorial you completed
- Applications with broken functionality
- Projects you found frustrating or didn't connect with
- Work that doesn't represent your current skill level

**Remember**: Your AGOL account persists after graduation specifically so you can maintain these portfolio pieces. Keep your best work live and accessible.

## Creating Your Landing Page

Use `webapps.md` as your landing page that:
- Lists all web applications
- Shows screenshots of each
- Provides brief descriptions
- Links to live applications
- Notes skills demonstrated

## Application URLs

**Important**: Include working links to your live applications
- Test all links before sharing your portfolio
- Ensure applications are set to Public or Shared appropriately
- Keep applications active and maintained
- Update links if you move or rename applications

**Example URL formats:**
- Dashboard: `https://your-org.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/...`
- Experience Builder: `https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/...`
- StoryMap: `https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/...`
- Survey123: `https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/...`

## Tips for Success

### Maintain Your Applications
- **Keep data current**: Update datasets as needed
- **Test periodically**: Ensure applications still work
- **Fix broken links**: If data sources change, update apps
- **Monitor performance**: Check that apps load quickly
- **Refresh content**: Update descriptions or features as you learn more

### Before Sharing Your Portfolio
- **Test all links**: Click every URL to ensure they work
- **Review permissions**: Ensure apps are publicly accessible
- **Check on mobile**: View on phone/tablet to ensure responsiveness
- **Proofread text**: Check all descriptions and labels in apps
- **Update screenshots**: Ensure images match current app state

### Security and Privacy
- **No sensitive data**: Don't publish apps with confidential information
- **Check data permissions**: Ensure you have rights to share data sources
- **Consider audience**: Make sure content is appropriate for public viewing
- **Privacy settings**: Set appropriate sharing levels in AGOL

## How Many Applications to Include?

**Starting out**: 1-2 well-designed applications

**Recommended**: 3-5 applications showing variety:
- Different platforms (Dashboard, Experience Builder, StoryMap)
- Different purposes (analysis, storytelling, data collection)
- Different design approaches

**Maximum**: 6-8 applications (focus on quality and diversity)

### What to Avoid

**Weak description:**
"Map I made for class."

**Why it's weak**: No description of purpose, features, or skills. Doesn't help employers understand your capabilities or the complexity of the work.
