## What Makes a Good Portfolio?

A strong GIS portfolio demonstrates your technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and growth over time. It should be easy to navigate, professionally presented, and clearly communicate what you can do.

### Key Characteristics of Strong Portfolios

**Clear and Focused**
- Each project has a clear purpose and outcome
- Technical skills are explicitly stated
- Methods are described in enough detail that someone could understand your workflow

**Professional Presentation**
- Clean, readable layout
- Consistent formatting across projects
- Free of typos and grammatical errors
- Professional tone (avoid overly casual language)

**Evidence-Based**
- Shows actual work products (maps, code, analysis results)
- Includes specific methods and tools used
- Demonstrates progression of skills over time

**Accessible**
- Easy to navigate
- Works on mobile devices
- Loads quickly
- Contact information is easy to find

## What Makes a Bad Portfolio?

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Vague Descriptions**
- NO: "Used GIS to analyze data"
- YES: "Performed spatial join of census tracts to ZIP codes, calculated population-weighted centroids, and generated kernel density maps using ArcGIS Pro"

**Missing Context**
- NO: Just showing a map with no explanation
- YES: Explaining what the project was, what methods you used, and what the results showed

**Overly Technical Without Explanation**
- NO: "Applied NDVI algorithm to Landsat 8 OLI data"
- YES: "Calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 satellite imagery to assess vegetation health across the study area"

**Too Much Text**
- NO: Long paragraphs describing every detail
- YES: Concise bullets and short paragraphs highlighting key methods and findings

**Outdated or Broken Content**
- Dead links to projects or code
- "Under construction" placeholders
- Very old projects without recent work

**Unprofessional Presentation**
- Inconsistent formatting
- Poor image quality
- Cluttered layouts
- Distracting backgrounds or fonts

## Writing Strong Project Descriptions

### The Method Description Formula

Good method descriptions answer: **What did you do? How did you do it? What tools did you use?**

**Weak example:**
> "I made a map of population density."

**Strong example:**
> "Created a population density choropleth map by joining census data to county boundaries, normalizing population by area, classifying values using quantile breaks, and designing the layout in ArcGIS Pro with appropriate symbology and map elements."

### Skills Lists: Be Specific

**Weak:**
- Data analysis
- Mapping
- Python

**Strong:**
- Spatial joins and overlay analysis (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS)
- Choropleth map design with appropriate classification schemes
- Python scripting for raster processing (gdal, rasterio)
- Statistical analysis of spatial patterns (Moran's I, hotspot analysis)

## Visual Design Tips

### Keep It Simple
- Use a clean, minimal design
- Stick to 2-3 colors maximum
- Choose readable fonts (avoid decorative fonts)
- Use white space effectively
- Ensure good contrast between text and background

### Images and Maps
- Use high-quality images (PNG format, appropriate resolution)
- Ensure maps are legible (readable labels, clear symbology)
- Crop images to remove unnecessary whitespace
- Add alt text for accessibility

### Consistency
- Use the same header styles throughout
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Apply the same date format everywhere
- Keep bullet point styles uniform

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

**For Each Project:**
- Title and date
- Brief overview (2-3 sentences)
- Methods and workflow
- Tools and technologies used
- Skills demonstrated
- Visual outputs (maps, charts, etc.)
- Links to code or data (when appropriate)
- Challenges faced and solutions (optional but valuable)

**On Your Homepage:**
- Your name
- Brief professional statement or academic focus
- Education
- Core skills
- Contact information
- Links to all projects
- Links to writing samples (if included)

**Consider a Writing Section:**
Your portfolio can include technical writing samples that demonstrate your ability to communicate spatial analysis and research. Consider creating a `writing/` folder in your repository for:
- Lab reports and technical reports
- Research proposals
- Technical memos
- Case studies

These documents show that you can not only perform GIS analysis but also communicate your methods and findings professionally - a critical skill for most GIS careers.

### What NOT to Include

- Personal photos (unless professional headshot)
- Home address or phone number
- Unfinished or placeholder projects
- Class assignments you're not proud of
- Excessive personal information
- Projects with no visual component or description

## Portfolio Organization Strategies

### Chronological (Good for Showing Growth)
List projects from most recent to oldest. This demonstrates skill progression over time.

### By Skill Area (Good for Specialists)
Group projects by focus: Remote Sensing, Spatial Analysis, Cartography, Web Mapping, etc.

### By Complexity (Good for Mixed Audiences)
Feature your best/most complex work first, simpler projects later.

### Hybrid Approach
Feature 3-5 best projects prominently, then organize the rest chronologically or by category.

## Maintaining Your Portfolio

### Regular Updates
- Add projects as you complete them (don't wait until job hunting)
- Review and update every semester
- Remove outdated or weak projects as you produce better work
- Update skills list as you learn new techniques

### Quality Over Quantity
- 5 strong, well-documented projects > 20 poorly described ones
- It's okay to remove old work that no longer represents your skills
- Focus on projects that show diverse skills or significant complexity
- **Include work you're proud of and interested in** - if you hated a particular course or project type, you don't need to force it into your portfolio
- Your portfolio should reflect your strengths and interests, not just check boxes of everything you've learned
- Employers can tell when you're passionate about work vs. when you're just fulfilling requirements

### Before Sharing Your Portfolio

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All links work
- [ ] All images load properly
- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
- [ ] Contact information is current
- [ ] Project descriptions are clear and specific
- [ ] Code repositories (if linked) are well-documented
- [ ] Portfolio displays correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] You're proud of everything included

## Getting Feedback

Before sending your portfolio to potential employers:
- Ask a peer to review it - can they understand what you did?
- Show it to your instructor
- Check it on different devices (phone, tablet, desktop)
- Read everything out loud to catch errors
- Have someone unfamiliar with GIS look at it - is it comprehensible?

## Remember

Your portfolio is a living document. It should grow and evolve as you do. Start simple, be honest about your skills, and focus on clearly communicating what you've learned and what you can do.

**The goal isn't perfection - it's demonstration of competence and growth.**
