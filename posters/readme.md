# Posters Guide

This folder contains your scientific and research posters. Posters demonstrate your ability to communicate complex research or analysis visually and concisely - a valuable skill for conferences, presentations, and professional communication.

## What to Include

**Include posters that:**
- Present completed research or analysis projects
- Demonstrate strong visual design and communication
- Show your ability to synthesize complex information
- You're proud of and can discuss confidently
- Represent professional-quality work

**You don't need to include:**
- Draft versions or unfinished posters
- Posters you weren't satisfied with
- Work that doesn't represent your current design skills
- Posters on topics you're not interested in discussing

**Remember**: Each poster should tell a complete story visually and be something you'd be comfortable presenting.

## Types of Posters to Consider

### Research Posters
Conference-style posters presenting:
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Methodology and data sources
- Results and findings
- Conclusions and implications
- References and acknowledgments

### Project Posters
Posters documenting GIS/remote sensing projects:
- Project objectives and context
- Technical approach and methods
- Key outputs and visualizations
- Applications and recommendations

### Educational Posters
Posters created for coursework that demonstrate:
- Understanding of spatial concepts
- Ability to visualize complex data
- Professional design skills
- Clear communication

## What Makes a Strong Poster?

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear title visible from distance
- Logical flow (usually left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Important information stands out
- Appropriate use of white space

### Content Balance
- Not too text-heavy (rule of thumb: can be read in 3-5 minutes)
- High-quality maps and graphics
- Concise text in bullets or short paragraphs
- Clear section headers

### Design Quality
- Consistent fonts and colors
- Professional color scheme
- High-resolution images (300 dpi minimum)
- Proper alignment and spacing
- Readable from 3-6 feet away

### Scientific Rigor
- Clear methods description
- Proper data citations
- Appropriate visualizations for the data
- Honest representation of results
- Acknowledgment of limitations

## File Formats

**Upload PDFs to this folder:**
- High-quality PDF preserves design
- Easily downloadable and viewable
- Print-ready if needed
- Original design files (PowerPoint, Adobe, etc.) can stay local

**Also create thumbnail images:**
- PNG format, moderate resolution
- Allows preview on your landing page
- Store in main `images/` folder
- Filename: `poster-thumbnail-projectname.png`

**File naming:**
- Descriptive: `wildfire-risk-assessment-poster.pdf`
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Include year if helpful: `urban-heat-poster-2024.pdf`

## Creating Your Landing Page

Use `posters.md` as your landing page that:
- Shows thumbnail preview of each poster
- Provides context (event/course, date, co-authors)
- Describes key methods and findings briefly
- Links to full PDF download
- Lists skills demonstrated

## Including Poster Information

For each poster, document:

**Event/Course Context**
- Was it for a conference, class, or independent project?
- Include course name or conference details
- Note if it was accepted/presented

**Collaboration**
- List co-authors if applicable
- Note your specific contributions
- Be honest about collaborative work

**Key Methods**
- Brief bullets highlighting technical approaches
- Tools and software used
- Data sources

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Visual communication
- Data visualization
- Specific GIS/remote sensing techniques
- Research synthesis
- Design software proficiency

## Tips for Success

### Before Uploading
- **Export high-quality PDF**: Ensure all images are crisp
- **Check file size**: Large files (>20MB) may be slow to download
- **Create thumbnail**: Make a smaller preview image
- **Verify links work**: Test that PDFs download correctly
- **Get permission**: If collaborative, ensure co-authors approve sharing

### Presenting Your Posters
- **Be ready to discuss**: Know your methods and findings
- **Explain context**: When and why it was created
- **Highlight challenges**: What problems did you solve?
- **Note improvements**: What would you do differently now?

### Design Considerations
- **Print size**: Most academic posters are 36"x48" or similar
- **Resolution**: 300 dpi for print quality
- **Color**: Consider how it looks both on screen and printed
- **Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast, readable fonts

## How Many Posters to Include?

**Starting out**: 1-2 strong posters is plenty

**Recommended**: 2-4 posters showing different projects or topics

**Maximum**: 5-6 posters (quality over quantity)

If you have many posters, select those that:
- Show your best work
- Demonstrate different skills
- Cover diverse topics
- You can discuss confidently

## Examples

### Strong Poster Description

**Title**: Assessing Water Quality in Mountain Lakes Using Landsat 8 Imagery  
**Event**: AAG Annual Meeting 2024  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Co-authors**: Dr. Jane Smith (Faculty Advisor)

**Overview**: This poster presents a remote sensing approach to monitoring water quality parameters in alpine lakes across Colorado. The study demonstrates the correlation between Landsat 8 spectral bands and in-situ measurements of chlorophyll-a and turbidity.

**Key Methods**:
- Atmospheric correction of Landsat 8 imagery
- Band ratio algorithms for water quality parameters
- Statistical correlation analysis with field measurements
- Time series analysis across multiple seasons
- Spatial interpolation of water quality metrics

**Tools Used**: ArcGIS Pro, Python (gdal, scikit-learn), R (statistical analysis)

### What to Avoid

**Weak description:**
"Poster from GIS class."

**Why it's weak**: No context about content, methods, or skills demonstrated. Doesn't help employers understand what you can do.
