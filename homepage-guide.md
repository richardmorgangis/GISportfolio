# Homepage Guide

Your portfolio homepage (`index.md` or `index.html`) is the first thing hiring managers see. This is your chance to make a strong first impression and convince them to explore your work.

## IMPORTANT: This is a Public Website
**If you have concerns about having your name on the internet, that is completely understandable and there are options.** See the [Safety and Privacy Concerns](#safety-and-privacy-concerns) section below for ways to build a portfolio while protecting your privacy and safety.

---

Your portfolio is live on the internet and accessible to anyone with the link. This is different from most coursework in the GIS program, which is typically shared only within your organization, behind a login, or in MyCourse/D2L.

What this means:
- Anyone can find and view your portfolio (it's public, not password-protected)
- Search engines may index your page
- Future employers, colleagues, or anyone else can see what you post
- You control what information you share

Be thoughtful about privacy:
- Don't include your home address or phone number
- Don't share personal information you wouldn't put on a resume
- Don't post sensitive or confidential data
- Use your college email or a professional email address
- Remember: once it's on the internet, it's public

This is a professional document, not social media. Treat it like a public resume.

### Safety and Privacy Concerns

If you have safety concerns about having a public web presence (stalking, harassment, privacy issues, etc.), you have options:

**Option 1: Limited Public Portfolio**
- Use only your first name and last initial (e.g., "Jordan M.")
- Use your college email only (no personal contact info)
- Don't include photos
- Be selective about project locations (no home address in project contexts)
- Don't mention specific employers or internship locations if they could identify you
- Remove your name from map layouts, cartographic credits, and metadata in images before uploading
- Edit PDF exports to remove author information and metadata

**Option 2: Password-Protected or Private Alternatives**
- Create your portfolio but don't enable GitHub Pages (keep it private in GitHub)
- Share the GitHub repository link directly with employers (they can view with permission)
- Use a PDF portfolio instead of a website (see [Paper Portfolio Guide](paper-portfolio-guide.md))
- Build your portfolio in a password-protected platform and share access only when needed

**Option 3: Delay Public Portfolio**
- Complete the portfolio work privately
- Only make it public when actively job searching
- Take it down between job searches if needed

Remember: A web portfolio is valuable but not mandatory. If you have legitimate safety concerns, prioritize your safety. You can still demonstrate your skills through:
- PDF portfolios shared directly with employers
- Private GitHub repositories shared by invitation
- Work samples presented during interviews
- Projects showcased in your network through professional contacts

Talk to your instructor if you have concerns. There are ways to build a professional portfolio while maintaining your safety and privacy.

## What NOT to Include

Before we discuss what to include, let's be clear about what should NOT be on your public portfolio homepage:

**Personal Information (Privacy Concerns):**
- Home address or phone number (email is sufficient)
- Age, birth date, marital status
- Children's names or photos
- Social security number or other sensitive IDs
- Personal social media (unless professional like LinkedIn)

**Unprofessional Content:**
- Personal photos (unless it's a professional headshot and you choose to include it)
- Casual social media links (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook)
- Hobbies unrelated to your career
- Political or religious affiliations
- Controversial opinions or personal blog posts

**Unnecessary Academic Details:**
- Every class you've ever taken (skills section covers this)
- High school information
- GPA (unless it's exceptional and specifically requested)
- Detailed course descriptions

**Generic or Unhelpful Content:**
- "Under construction" notices (just don't link to incomplete sections)
- "Objective statements" like "Seeking a position in GIS..." (save for cover letters)
- Generic mission statements that could apply to anyone
- Placeholder text or [lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)

**Weak or Outdated Work:**
- Projects you're not proud of
- Assignments that didn't go well
- Very old work that doesn't represent your current skills (unless showing progression)

Remember: You control what the world sees. Be selective and professional.

## The Critical Truth: The Top Third Rule

**Most hiring managers only look at the top 1/3 to 1/2 of your homepage.** 

They're busy. They're looking at dozens or hundreds of portfolios. If the top of your page doesn't grab their attention and show them you're worth their time, they'll move on to the next candidate.

**What this means for you:**
- Your best information must be at the top
- Every line in the top section needs to count
- Lead with strengths, not generic statements
- Make it easy to see your value immediately

Think of it like a resume: The top half is prime real estate. Don't waste it.

## What to Include (In Order of Importance)

### 1. Your Name (Header)
- Make it prominent but not huge
- This is professional, not a billboard

### 2. About / Professional Statement (Required)
**Purpose:** Immediately tell them who you are professionally

**Include:**
- Your career focus or interests in GIS/remote sensing
- What makes you unique or interesting
- Keep it to 1-2 sentences maximum

**Example - Weak:**
> "I'm a GIS student learning spatial analysis."

**Example - Strong:**
> "Geospatial analyst specializing in environmental conservation and wildlife habitat modeling, combining remote sensing expertise with field ecology experience."

Keep it concise and specific. Generic statements like "passionate about GIS" don't differentiate you.

### 3. Background & Area of Focus (Highly Recommended)
**Purpose:** Show you're not just a GIS technician - you understand a field

**Include:**
- Your area of focus beyond just GIS (environmental science, urban planning, public health, etc.)
- What problems you want to solve
- Relevant background or experience

**Example - Weak:**
> "I know how to use ArcGIS and Python."

**Example - Strong:**
> "Background in forestry and natural resource management. I use GIS and remote sensing to analyze forest health, assess wildfire risk, and support sustainable land management decisions."

**Why this matters:** Employers hire people who understand problems, not just tools. Show them you bring expertise in a specific field.

### 4. Education (Required)
**Include:**
- Degree program name
- College
- Expected graduation date (or graduation date if completed)

**Keep it brief:**
```
Bachelor of Applied Science in Geospatial Science
Front Range Community College
Expected Graduation: May 2026
```

**Don't include:**
- GPA (unless it's exceptional and requested)
- Every course you've taken
- High school information

### 5. Skills (Required - But Be Strategic)
**Purpose:** Quick scan of what you can do

**Important: Quality over quantity.** Don't list every software you've ever opened. Focus on tools you're proficient with and that are relevant to jobs you want.

**Software Strategy:**
Our program exposes you to many software packages (Esri suite, NV5, Google Earth Engine, Trimble products, QGIS, Python libraries, etc.). You don't need to list all of them. Instead:

- **Group by capability**, not individual software names
- **Highlight what you're strongest in**
- **Tailor to your target jobs** - Esri-heavy positions? Emphasize ArcGIS Pro and AGOL. Open-source/Python roles? Emphasize QGIS and Python libraries. Surveying positions? Highlight GNSS and surveying software.
- **Be honest** - only include software you can confidently use in a work setting

**Example - Too much (software name-dropping):**
> ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, ENVI, Google Earth Engine, Pix4D, Agisoft Metashape, Trimble Access, Trimble Business Center, GeoPandas, Rasterio, GDAL, Fiona, Shapely, ArcPy, Python, R, SQL, PostgreSQL, PostGIS

**Example - Better (grouped by capability):**
> - **Desktop GIS:** ArcGIS Pro, QGIS
> - **Remote Sensing:** Google Earth Engine, ENVI, Landsat/Sentinel processing
> - **Programming:** Python (GeoPandas, Rasterio, ArcPy), SQL
> - **Spatial Databases:** PostgreSQL/PostGIS, ArcGIS Enterprise Geodatabase
> - **Survey/GNSS:** Trimble software suite (Trimble Access, Business Center)
> - **Web GIS:** ArcGIS Online (Dashboards, Experience Builder, StoryMaps)

**Two approaches:**

**Option A: Brief, High-Level (Recommended for top of page)**
List 5-7 of your strongest, most relevant skills:
- Advanced remote sensing analysis (Landsat, Sentinel, UAV imagery)
- Python programming for geospatial workflows (GeoPandas, Rasterio, GDAL)
- Spatial database design and management (PostgreSQL/PostGIS)
- Desktop GIS analysis (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS)
- Field data collection and GNSS workflows

**Option B: Categorized (Good, but takes more space)**
Break into categories as shown above.

**What NOT to include:**
- Basic computer skills (Microsoft Office, email, internet)
- Every single thing you've ever touched
- Software you only used once in a tutorial
- Soft skills here (save for cover letters)
- Skills you can't actually demonstrate or discuss confidently

Be honest. Only list skills you can discuss confidently in an interview and demonstrate in your projects.

### 6. Featured Projects (Critical - Top 2-3 Projects)
**Purpose:** Get them to click and see your work

**In the top section, feature your 2-3 BEST projects:**
- Link directly to the project pages
- Include one-sentence descriptions that highlight the work, not just the title

**Example - Weak:**
> - [Project 1](projects/project1.md)
> - [Project 2](projects/project2.md)

**Example - Strong:**
> - [Wildfire Risk Assessment](projects/wildfire-risk.md) - Multi-criteria raster analysis identifying high-risk areas across Colorado using vegetation, terrain, and proximity data
> - [Urban Heat Island Study](projects/urban-heat.md) - Landsat thermal analysis revealing 15°F temperature differences between land cover types in metro Denver
> - [Conservation Database Design](database/conservation-db.md) - Enterprise geodatabase supporting multi-user wildlife tracking and habitat assessment workflows

**Choose projects that:**
- Show technical depth
- Demonstrate different skills
- Are relevant to jobs you want
- You're most proud of
- You can discuss confidently

## What Goes Below the Fold (Optional Sections)

These sections are valuable but can go lower on the page:

**Additional Projects Section**
- Link to all other projects
- Or organize by category (Remote Sensing, Spatial Analysis, Cartography, etc.)

**Database Design & Data Modeling**
- If you have this work, include it

**Web Applications**
- Links to Dashboards, Experience Builder, StoryMaps, etc.

**Writing & Posters**
- Links to technical writing and poster pages

**Contact Information**
- Email (college or professional)
- GitHub profile
- LinkedIn (optional)
- Physical address NOT needed

## Length and Organization

**Ideal homepage length:** 
- Short enough to scroll through quickly (1-2 scroll pages maximum)
- Long enough to show your range (not just 3 lines)

**If your homepage is getting long:**
- Move detailed project lists to separate pages by category
- Feature only top projects on homepage
- Use "See all projects" links to dedicated pages

**Organization strategies:**

**Option 1: Simple and Direct (Recommended for most)**
1. Name
2. About / Background
3. Education
4. Core Skills
5. Featured Projects (top 3)
6. Links to additional content sections
7. Contact

**Option 2: Project-First (For strong project portfolio)**
1. Name  
2. Brief About
3. Top 3 Featured Projects (with visuals)
4. Skills
5. Education
6. Additional sections
7. Contact

**Option 3: Focus Area-Driven (For specialized fields)**
1. Name
2. Area of Focus (longer background section)
3. Featured Projects related to area of focus
4. Technical Skills
5. Education
6. Additional sections
7. Contact

## Design and Readability

**Keep it clean:**
- Use consistent formatting
- Don't overuse bold or colors
- Ensure good contrast (readable text)
- Use whitespace effectively
- Stick to 1-2 fonts maximum

**Make it scannable:**
- Use clear section headers
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Don't wall-of-text anything

**Mobile-friendly:**
- Test on your phone
- Ensure text is readable on small screens
- Links should be easy to tap

## Testing Your Homepage

Before sharing your portfolio, ask yourself:

**The 30-Second Test:**
If someone looked at only the top half of your homepage for 30 seconds, would they:
- Know who you are professionally?
- Understand what you're good at?
- Want to look at your projects?
- Have a sense of what makes you different from other GIS students?

**The Honest Test:**
- Does this represent my actual skills and interests?
- Can I discuss everything I've listed confidently?
- Is this my best work featured?
- Would I hire me based on this?

**The Peer Review Test:**
- Show it to a classmate or instructor
- Can they quickly understand what you do?
- Does anything confuse them?
- What would they change?

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Being Too Generic**
"GIS student interested in spatial analysis" could be anyone. Be specific about your interests and strengths.

**Mistake 2: Hiding Your Best Work**
Don't bury your strongest projects at the bottom. Feature them at the top.

**Mistake 3: Listing Skills You Can't Demonstrate**
If you touched Python once in a tutorial, don't list "Python programming" as a core skill.

**Mistake 4: Too Much Text**
Long paragraphs lose readers. Keep it concise and scannable.

**Mistake 5: No Area of Focus**
GIS is a tool. Show what you use it FOR.

**Mistake 6: Neglecting the Visual**
If your homepage is all text with no project links or indicators of visual work, it's not engaging.
